# COP290

## Queue and dynamic density estimation from traffic video
* Our program takes a traffic video as an input and after camera angle and frame correction as per the points selected by the user generates data for queue density and dynamic density for the traffic on that particular road.
* More information can be found on our [course webpage](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rijurekha/cop290_2021.html) 

## Instructions
To run the program write the following commands on your terminal
* `$ make` to compile density.cpp to a binary a.o
* Select `4` points and press `Esc` to see the data for queue and dynamic density being computed. Press `Esc` again to terminate the process before completion.
* After the video has finished press `Esc` to finish the program.

## Error Handling
* Only your first 4 clicks will be considered for selection and thus avoid selecting more than 50 points.
